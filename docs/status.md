# Olyve

**What:** Knowledge management + communication for small AI-powered teams. Daily AI interviews capture context, knowledge graph stores it, auto-standups expose it.

**Phase:** Pre-build — needs clarity session

**Key number:** 0% built (target: 30% core by end of Feb)

---

## What Just Shipped

_Nothing yet. Build hasn't started._

## What's Next

1. **Clarity session** — define exactly what the MVP is, who the first 10 targets are, what "30% done" means
2. **Start building core feature** — daily interview + knowledge graph
3. **Draft 10 target companies** for pilot outreach

## Blocking / Waiting

- Clarity — vision is clear but specific build scope isn't defined
- Time — Fotora outreach is eating most available hours right now
