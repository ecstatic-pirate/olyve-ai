# Olyve

**What:** The shared memory layer for AI-native teams. Every AI agent reads from and writes to Olyve via MCP. Org-scoped, living context — not another wiki.

**Phase:** Post-clarity, pre-build

**Key number:** 0% built (target: 30% core by end of Feb)

---

## What Just Shipped

- Clarity session completed (Feb 19) — full strategy pivot
- Killed: standup replacement wedge, "capture via interviews," template repo, raw API play
- New hypothesis locked: "The Company Knowledge Agent" — shared memory for AI agents via MCP
- Competitive landscape mapped (Supermemory, Mem0, Notion AI, Obsidian)
- Architecture defined: ingestion layer → knowledge model → MCP server → agent experience

## What's Next

1. **Resolve open questions** — entry point (Layer 1 vs Layer 2?), packaging (CLI? MCP server?), minimum pilot scope
2. **Draft 10 target companies** for pilot outreach
3. **Define MVP build scope** — what "30% done" actually means with the new hypothesis
4. **Start building** — likely the MCP server + knowledge model first

## Blocking / Waiting

- Open questions from clarity session need answers before build starts (see `olyve-clarity-session.md`)
- Time — Fotora outreach still primary, Olyve gets 30% of project hours
